# Task 1- Perform Basic Mathematical Operations.

a = input('Enter the first number: ')
b = input('Enter the second number: ')

# Numbers
a = 5
b = 10


# Addition
addition = a + b

# Subtraction
subtraction = a - b

# Multiplication
multiplication = a * b

# Division
division = a / b


# Print result
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
